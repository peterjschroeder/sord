	'  After your bloody duel with the huge Dragon, your first inpulse is to',
	'  rip it\'s head off and bring it town.  Carefull thought reveals it is',
	'  much to big for your horse, so that plan is moot.  Your second notion',
	'  is bring back the childrens bones.  Bags and bags of them for proper',
	'  barial, but you realize this would only cause the towns inhabitants',
	'  MORE pain.  You finally decide on the Dragons heart.  After adding',
	'  ten years to your swords life, you finally chip off enough scales to',
	'  wallow in the huge beasts insides.','',
	'  When you are finished, and fit the still heart in a gunny sack you',
	'  brought, (who would have thought this would be its use?) you make',
	'  your way back to town.  As you share your story to a crowd of excited',
	'  onlookers, this crowd becomes a gathering, and this gathering becomes',
	'  an assemblage, and this assemblage becomes a multitude!','',
	'  This multitude nearly becomes a mob, but thinking quick, you make a',
	'  speech.','',
	'  "PEOPLE!" your voice booms.  "It is true I have ridden this town of',
	'  it\'s curse, the Red Dragon.  And this is his heart."','',
	'  You dump the bloody object onto the ground.  From the back, Barak\'s',
	'  voice is heard.  "How do we know where you got that thing?  It looks',
	'  like you skinned a sheep!"  A flicker of annoyance crosses your face,',
	'  but you force a smile.  "Why Barak, would you doubt me?  A LEVEL 12',
	'  warrior?  If I am not mistaken, you are quite a bit lower, still at',
	'  level two, eh?"','',
	'  Barak gives you no more trouble, and you are declared a hero by all.',
	'  Violet tops off the evening by giving you a kiss on the cheek, and a',
	'  whisper of things to come later that night makes even you almost',
	'  blush.  Almost.'],[
	'  Still shaking from the battle, you decide it is time to return to',
	'  town and share the good tidings.  You close your eyes and',
	'  concentrate.  "There is no place like Town"...A when you open your',
	'  eyes, you are under a cow in a farm outside - Not far from Abduls',
	'  Armour.  You trek the distance to the Armoury, cursing as you go.',
	'  Wizards were not made for this kind of hardship you tell yourself.','',
	'  Miss Abdul is estatic when you tell her about your escapades.  She',
	'  agrees to accompany you to the Inn.  She lends you a horse when you',
	'  tell her of how your feet ache.','',
	'  When you enter the smokey bar with a loud clatter, merry makers stop',
	'  their carousing, people hunched over their meals stop chewing and',
	'  Seth Able stops playing in mid-strum.','',
	'  "People!  I have slain the beast!" you shout triumphantly. A voice is',
	'  heard from the back. "What beast?  A large rat or something?"  You',
	'  scowl.  It is Barak.  You nonchalantly make a gesture with one hand.',
	'  A few moments later, Barak stands up suprised.  He looks wildly',
	'  around, then makes a bolt for the door.','',
	'  "What happened to him?" Miss Adbul asks you in puzzlement.','',
	'  "Nature called." you smile.  Your face becomes serious as you address',
	'  the bar.  "The Red Dragon is no more." Violet sets her serving tray',
	'  down to hear better. "We cannot bring back those dead, but I have',
	'  stopped this from happening again."','',
	'  "And he did it with Armour from Abduls Armour!" Miss Abdul adds.','',
	'  "Er, thank you.  Anyway, make sure you put something in the Daily',
	'  happenings about this!"  The crowd gives you a standing ovation.'],[
	'  You breath a sigh of relief, retrieve your daggers and carefully',
	'  clean them. Although you realized some may think it cold hearted if',
	'  they ever found out, you pick through the childrens bones, picking up',
	'  a gold piece here, a silver there. Afterall, these children didn\'t',
	'  need it to buy a meal anymore... They WERE a meal!  You smile at',
	'  your own dry wit and realize you had better get to town and share the',
	'  news.','',
	'  The hike to town is long, but you are used to it, and rather enjoy',
	'  the peace it brings.  You find the town deserted.  You enter the Inn,',
	'  hoping find some clue, but all you find is Violet.','',
	'  "Via, Where has everyone gone?  Have they finally given up hope of',
	'  ever stopping the Red Dragon, and have gone to seek a new lifestyle?','',
	'  There is a pause, then she responds.','',
	'  "No, they are having a feast at Turgons Place.  Naturally SOMEONE had',
	'  to stay here, and OF COURSE it would be me...I never get to have any',
	'  fun!"','',
	'  You give her a wink.  "That just isn\'t so...Remember last night?"',
	'  She giggles, and after a few more naughty sayings you have her cheeks',
	'  as deep a scarlet as a rose.','',
	'  When you finally meet up at Turgons, you share your story.  You can\'t',
	'  help but be pleased at seeing so many faces in awe over your doings,',
	'  so you \'spice\' up the story in a few places... As you are finishing,',
	'  a woman in the back cries out.','',
	'  "That Thief is wearing the ring I gave my Ellie the last birthday',
	'  before disappeared!"','',
	'  You decide now would be the perfect time to make your departure.']]
