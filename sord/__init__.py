""" Saga of the Red Dragon

 * A blatent rip off of Seth Able Robinson's BBS Door Masterpiece.  
 * All attempts were made to be as close to the original as possible, 
 * including some original artwork, the original fight equations, and 
 * most especially the original spelling and punctuation mistakes.  Enjoy.

 * This package includes all program logic, flow, artwork, menus, etc
 * for the S.O.R.D. server / game.  It is intended as a standalone 
 * program, but packaged incase anyone finds the means and methods
 * contained herin to be useful in the least
